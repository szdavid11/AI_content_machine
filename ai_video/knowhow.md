Here are concise, practical points distilled from expert guides, blogs and marketing research on what helps a short video go viral:

* Know your target audience – define demographics, interests, pain points and goals to craft content that resonates.
* Pick a format that fits your message (explainer, tutorial, story, listicle, testimonial) and your audience.
* Grab attention in the first 1–3 seconds with bold text, movement, a curiosity‑creating question or a “wait…what?” moment.
* Start mid‑action; avoid slow intros or fade‑ins.
* Use a mix of visual, written and verbal hooks (on‑screen text plus spoken teaser); keep hooks clear and use power words like “secret” or “crazy”.
* Deliver on your hook’s promise; don’t mislead viewers.
* Tell a mini‑story with a setup, twist and resolution; take viewers on an emotional ride in as little as 15 seconds.
* Evoke high‑arousal emotions (awe, amusement, surprise, controlled anger) to inspire shares.
* Make content relatable by addressing universal experiences and cultural references.
* Provide genuine value – teach a useful skill or solve a problem.
* Break scroll fatigue with bright visuals, bold text and unexpected twists or shocking facts.
* Keep videos short; sweet spots are 15–30 s for TikTok/Reels and 30–50 s for YouTube Shorts.
* Edit fast – use jump cuts, on‑beat edits and varied visuals; eliminate pauses and filler.
* Build replay value – speed up text, hide Easter eggs, make the end match the beginning and finish your hook at the end.
* Invest in quality production – clear video, good lighting, crisp audio and polished editing.
* Use trending sounds/music and relevant hashtags; trending audio helps algorithms surface your video.
* Ride trends quickly and authentically; participate in challenges and memes but add your own spin.
* Shoot vertical (9:16), center key visuals and use large captions so silent scrollers can follow.
* Always add subtitles or text overlays – most viewers watch without sound.
* Craft curiosity‑driven titles and eye‑catching opening frames (thumbnails) that hint at the payoff.
* Post at peak times when your audience is active (e.g., evenings on TikTok/Instagram; noon or evening on YouTube).
* Encourage comments and shares – ask a question or prompt viewers to tag someone.
* Engage with your community by responding to comments and fostering conversation.
* Cross‑post and repurpose – share the same video on TikTok, Reels, Shorts, Pinterest, etc. to maximize reach.
* Use analytics to test different hooks, intros and formats; track watch time, completion rate, replays and shares and double down on what works.
* Be authentic – raw, spontaneous moments and personal quirks feel more relatable.
* Collaborate with influencers and encourage user‑generated content to tap into network effects.
* Plan content around topics you’re passionate and knowledgeable about, and be prepared to engage with feedback.
* Stay consistent – post regularly so algorithms recognize and reward your content.
* Optimize metadata – even for Shorts, titles, descriptions and hashtags aid discovery and search.
